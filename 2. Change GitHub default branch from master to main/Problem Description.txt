1. I had created a main branch in GitHub with a Readme file.

2. Followed by uploading my local Git repo to a new branch in GitHub, named 'master'.

3. Next I intended to move everything from master to main and remove master both locally and remotely.

4. When I used the command "git push -u origin main", this is where the problem arose.

"Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"

5. When tried to "git pull", another error showed
"fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
