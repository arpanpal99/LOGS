Step 1:
Download SQL Developer with or without JRE from the link:
https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html
(I downloaded SQL Developer without JRE because I had JRE already installed in my system at "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_291")

Step 2: 
Unzip SQL Developer at "C:\Program Files" by creating a new folder according to your wish (Recommended)
(I extracted it to the location "C:\app\arpan\product\sqldeveloper", 
to keep both oracle 18c and SQL Dev under "C:\app\arpan\product" directory)

Step 3:
No more "installation" required for SQL Dev. 
You can double click "sqldeveloper.exe" present at your extracted directory to open SQL Developer.
