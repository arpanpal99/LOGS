Considering you have Oracle Database 18C Express Edition installed in your system 
and all the java paths are properly declared for eclipse to work

Step 1: 
CREATE A PROJECT "Test_OJDBC_Connection"

Step 2:
1.png	Right click on the project name --> Build path --> Add libraries --> 
2.png	Connectivity Driver Definition --> 
3.jpg	Click on the button with a circular shape with a star within it (New Driver Definition) --> New Driver Definition Window opens
4.png	Choose Oracle from the Vendor Filter drop down menu --> 
5.png	Choose Oracle Thin Driver with system version 10 --> Set the Driver Name according to your choice -->
6.png	Go to JAR List --> Remove the existing jar files
7.png	Add JAR/ZIP --> Choose 'orjdbc8.jar' that comes along with Oracle Database 18C Express Edition --> Click Open
	(For me it's present at location "C:\app\arpan\product\18.0.0\dbhomeXE\jdbc\lib")
	(It's generally present in 'jdbc\lib' folder within your Oracle DB Home directory
8.png	Click on the newly added driver within the "Driver files" --> Click Ok
9.png	Choose your newly defined driver from the "Available Driver Definitions" within "Add library" window.
10.png	Click Finish.

Thus you can access your Oracle Database from Eclipse.

And even if your database gets updated by someone else from somewhere else (like, SQL Dev), 
you can refresh the project in Eclipse and view the latest tables and changes made.
