For me it was showing an error in SQL Dev "Welcome Page" under "Database Detected" section,
because it was unable to find "tnsnames.ora".

Solution is provided here:

Step 1:
I added an environment variable named "TNS_ADMIN" and set the path to 
"C:\app\arpan\product\18.0.0\dbhomeXE\network\admin\sample" bacause for me this tnsnames.ora was located there.
Refer "6. My 'tnsnames.ora' file location.png".

Step 2:
I restarted SQL Dev and the problem was solved.
